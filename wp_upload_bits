Function Reference/wp upload bits « WordPress Codex
-----------

Create a file in the upload folder with given content.

If there is an error, then the key '`error`' will exist with the error
message. If success, then the key '`file`' will have the unique file
path, the '`url`' key will have the link to the new file. and the
'`error`' key will be set to false.

This function will not move an uploaded file to the upload folder. It
will create a new file with the content in `$bits` parameter. If you
move the upload file, read the content of the uploaded file, and then
you can give the filename and content to this function, which will add
it to the upload folder.

The permissions will be set on the new file automatically by this
function.

Return Values

The function returns an array with the following keys:

file
:   The file system path to the uploaded file (e.g.
    /var/www/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/example.pdf)
url
:   The URL to the uploaded file (e.g.
    [http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/example.pdf](http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/example.pdf "http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/example.pdf"))
error

Examples
--------

Here's a simple example assuming the request was made from a form with a
file field called field1:

    $upload = wp_upload_bits($_FILES["field1"]["name"], null, file_get_contents($_FILES["field1"]["tmp_name"]));

The function attempts to save a copy of the uploaded file to the upload
directory set in the WordPress settings. It also performs security
checks (file type, size, etc) and returns errors if any (see Return
Values above). You might want to remove the tmp file after uploading.
