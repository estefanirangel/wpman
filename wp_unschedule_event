Function Reference/wp unschedule event « WordPress Codex
-----------

Un-schedules a previously-scheduled cron job.

Usage
-----

`  <?php wp_unschedule_event( $timestamp, $hook, $args ); ?> `

Note that you need to know the exact time of the next occurrence when
scheduled hook was set to run, and the function arguments it was
supposed to have, in order to unschedule it. All future occurrences are
un-scheduled by calling this function.

Parameters
----------

 `$timestamp` 
:   ([*integer*](/How_to_Pass_Tag_Parameters#Integer "How to Pass Tag Parameters"))
    (*required*) Timestamp originally provided for when to run the
    event.
    Default: *None*

 `$hook` 
:   ([*string*](/How_to_Pass_Tag_Parameters#String "How to Pass Tag Parameters"))
    (*required*) Action hook originally provided, the execution of which
    will be unscheduled.
    Default: *None*

 `$args` 
:   ([*string*](/How_to_Pass_Tag_Parameters#String "How to Pass Tag Parameters"))
    (*optional*) Arguments to pass to the hook's callback function.
    Although not passed to a callback function, these arguments are used
    to uniquely identify the scheduled event, so they should be the same
    as those used when originally scheduling the event.
    Default: array()

Return Value
------------

This function does not return a value

Example
-------

    <?php
        $timestamp = wp_next_scheduled( 'my_schedule_hook' );
        wp_unschedule_event($timestamp, 'my_schedule_hook', original_args );
    ?>
