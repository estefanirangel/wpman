Function Reference/wp count posts « WordPress Codex
-----------

This function was introduced in WordPress [Version
2.5](/Version_2.5 "Version 2.5"), and outputs the number for each post
status of a post type. You can also use `wp_count_posts()` as a
template\_tag with the second parameter and include the private post
status. By default, or if the user isn't logged in or is a guest of your
site, then private post status post count will not be included.

This function will return an object with the post statuses as the
properties. You should check for the property using `isset()` PHP
function, if you are wanting the value for the private post status. Not
all post statuses will be part of the object.

Usage
-----

`  <?php wp_count_posts( $type, $perm ); ?> `

Parameters
----------

 `$type` 
:   ([*string*](/How_to_Pass_Tag_Parameters#String "How to Pass Tag Parameters"))
    (*optional*) Post type to count
    Default: 'post'

 `$perm` 
:   ([*string*](/How_to_Pass_Tag_Parameters#String "How to Pass Tag Parameters"))
    (*optional*) To include private posts readable by the current user,
    set to 'readable'
    Default: *empty string*

Examples
--------

### Default Usage

The default usage returns a count of the posts that are published. This
will be an object, you can var\_dump() the contents to debug the output.

    <?php
    $count_posts = wp_count_posts();
    ?>

### Get the Publish Status Post Count

To get the published status type, you would call the `wp_count_posts()`
function and then access the '**publish'** property.

    <?php
    $count_posts = wp_count_posts();

    $published_posts = $count_posts->publish;
    ?>

If you are developing for PHP5 only, then you can use shorthand, if you
only want to get one status. This will not work in PHP4 and if you want
to maintain backwards compatibility, then you must use the above code.

    <?php
    $published_posts = wp_count_posts()->publish;
    ?>

### Count Drafts

Counting drafts is handled the same way as the publish status.

    <?php
    $count_posts = wp_count_posts();

    $draft_posts = $count_posts->draft;
    ?>

### Count Pages

Counting pages status types are done in the same way as posts and make
use of the first parameter. Finding the number of posts for the post
status is done the same way as for posts.

    <?php
    $count_pages = wp_count_posts('page');
    ?>

### Other Uses

The `wp_count_posts()` can be used to find the number for post statuses
of any post type. This includes attachments or any post type added in
the future, either by a plugin or part of the WordPress Core.
