Function Reference/get plugins « WordPress Codex
-----------

Check the plugins directory and retrieve all plugin files with plugin
data.

WordPress only supports plugin files in the base plugins directory
(wp-content/plugins) and in one directory above the plugins directory
(wp-content/plugins/my-plugin). The file it looks for has the plugin
data and must be found in those two locations. It is recommended that do
keep your plugin files in directories.

The file with the plugin data is the file that will be included and
therefore needs to have the main execution for the plugin. This does not
mean everything must be contained in the file and it is recommended that
the file be split for maintainability. Keep everything in one file for
extreme optimization purposes.
