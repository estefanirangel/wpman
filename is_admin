Function Reference/is admin « WordPress Codex
-----------

This [Conditional Tag](/Conditional_Tags "Conditional Tags") checks if
the Dashboard or the administration panel is attempting to be displayed.
It *should not* be used as a means to verify whether the current user
has permission to view the Dashboard or the administration panel. This
is a boolean function that will return `true` if the URL being accessed
is in the admin section, or `false` for a front-end page.

Usage
-----

` <?php is_admin(); ?> `

Parameters
----------

This tag does not accept any parameters.

Return Values
-------------

 `(boolean)` 
:   True on success, false on failure.

Examples
--------

    if ( ! is_admin() ) {
         echo "You are viewing the theme";
    } else {
         echo "You are viewing the WordPress Administration Panels";
    }

Notes
-----

-   `is_admin()` will return `false` when trying to access wp-login.php.
-   `is_admin()` will return `true` when trying to make an ajax request.
-   `is_admin()` will return `true` for calls to load-scripts.php and
    load-styles.php.
-   `is_admin()` is *not* intended to be used for security checks. It
    will return true whenever the current URL is for a page on the admin
    side of WordPress. It does not check if the user is logged in, nor
    if the user even has access to the page being requested. It is a
    convenience function for plugins and themes to use for various
    purposes, but it is not suitable for validating secured requests.

Change Log
----------

Since: 1.5.1
