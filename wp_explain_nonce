Function Reference/wp explain nonce « WordPress Codex

**This function is deprecated as of WordPress 3.4.1. Please use
[wp\_nonce\_ays](/Function_Reference/wp_nonce_ays "Function Reference/wp nonce ays")
instead.**

Retrieve
[nonce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce "wikipedia:Cryptographic nonce")
action '`Are you sure`' message.

The action is split by verb and noun. The action format is as follows:
verb-action\_extra. The verb is before the first dash and has the format
of letters and no spaces and numbers. The noun is after the dash and
before the underscore, if an underscore exists. The noun is also only
letters.

The filter will be called for any action, which is not defined by
WordPress. You may use the filter for your plugin to explain nonce
actions to the user, when they get the "Are you sure?" message. The
filter is in the format of '`explain_nonce_$verb-$noun`' with the
`$verb` replaced by the found verb and the `$noun` replaced by the found
noun. The two parameters that are given to the hook are the localized
'`Are you sure you want to do this?`' message with the extra text (the
text after the underscore).
