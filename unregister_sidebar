Function Reference/unregister sidebar « WordPress Codex
-----------

De-registers a previously registered [sidebar](/Sidebars "Sidebars").

Usage
-----

`  <?php unregister_sidebar( $id ); ?> `

Parameters
----------

 `$id` 
:   ([*string*](/How_to_Pass_Tag_Parameters#String "How to Pass Tag Parameters"))
    (*required*) The ID of the sidebar when it was added.
    Default: *None*

Example
-------

If added to a child theme's functions.php file, this will remove the
footer sidebars registered by the TwentyTen theme.

    function remove_some_widgets(){

        // Unregister some of the TwentyTen sidebars
        unregister_sidebar( 'first-footer-widget-area' );
        unregister_sidebar( 'second-footer-widget-area' );
        unregister_sidebar( 'third-footer-widget-area' );
        unregister_sidebar( 'fourth-footer-widget-area' );
    }
    add_action( 'widgets_init', 'remove_some_widgets', 11 );

Notes
-----

In the example, note that we assign a priority of 11 when registering
the widgets\_init hook. This is because a child theme's functions.php
file is called before the parent theme's, which means that our call to
unregister\_sidebar() would accomplish nothing since the sidebar has not
yet been registered.

By lowering the priority of our action, we ensure that it is called
after the parent theme's functions.php file is loaded.

Change Log
----------

Since: 2.2.0

Source File
-----------
