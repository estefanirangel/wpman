Examples

### Show All attachments for the current post beside Thumb

To get all attachments beside the thumb you can use this function with
something like `get_posts()`.

Do this inside [The\_Loop](/The_Loop "The Loop") (where \$post-\>ID is
available).

    <?php

    $args = array(
        'post_type'   => 'attachment',
        'numberposts' => -1,
        'post_status' => null,
        'post_parent' => $post->ID,
        'exclude'     => get_post_thumbnail_id()
        );

    $attachments = get_posts( $args );

    if ( $attachments ) {
        foreach ( $attachments as $attachment ) {
            echo apply_filters( 'the_title', $attachment->post_title );
            the_attachment_link( $attachment->ID, false );
        }
    }

    ?>

Notes
-----

"Post Thumbnail" is an outdated term for "Featured Image". This function
returns the ID of the post's featured image. It does not return IDs of
other images attached to posts that are thumbnail sized.
