Function Reference/is plugin page « WordPress Codex
-----------

Returns true when the current request is for a plugin page in the
administration panel. For example, if the request is for
"[http://www.example.com/wp-admin/edit.php?page=some\_plugin.php](http://www.example.com/wp-admin/edit.php?page=some_plugin.php "http://www.example.com/wp-admin/edit.php?page=some_plugin.php")",
this will return true.

As of version 2.6, this appears to key off of the "page" URL parameter
and is based on the variable \$plugin\_page, set in wp-admin/admin.php.

Notice: is\_plugin\_page is **deprecated** since version 3.1 with no
alternative available.
