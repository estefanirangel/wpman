NB: this won't work for websites behind some load balancers, especially
Network Solutions hosted websites. To bodgy up a fix, save [this
gist](https://gist.github.com/webaware/4688802 "https://gist.github.com/webaware/4688802")
into the plugins folder and enable it. For details, read [WordPress
is\_ssl() doesn’t work behind some load
balancers](http://snippets.webaware.com.au/snippets/wordpress-is_ssl-doesnt-work-behind-some-load-balancers/ "http://snippets.webaware.com.au/snippets/wordpress-is_ssl-doesnt-work-behind-some-load-balancers/").

Websites behind load balancers or reverse proxies that support
HTTP\_X\_FORWARDED\_PROTO can be fixed by adding the following code to
the wp-config.php file, above the require\_once call:

    if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO']) && $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO'] == 'https')
        $_SERVER['HTTPS'] = 'on';
