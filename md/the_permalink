SYNOPSIS
--------

Displays the [URL](/Glossary#URI_and_URL "Glossary") for the
[permalink](/Glossary#Permalink "Glossary") to the post currently being
processed in [The Loop](/The_Loop "The Loop"). This tag must be within
[The Loop](/The_Loop "The Loop"), and is generally used to display the
permalink for each post, when the posts are being displayed. Since this
template tag is limited to displaying the permalink for the post that is
being processed, you cannot use it to display the permalink to an
arbitrary post on your weblog. Refer to
[get\_permalink()](/Template_Tags/get_permalink "Template Tags/get permalink")
if you want to get the permalink for a post, given its unique post id.
