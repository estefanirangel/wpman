get locale "MAY 2013" WordPress Codex "Function Reference"
==========================================================

NAME
----

get locale - Gets the current locale.

SYNOPSIS
--------

Gets the current locale.

If the locale is set, then it will filter the locale in the '`locale`'
filter hook and return the value.

If the locale is not set already, then the WPLANG constant is used if it
is defined. Then it is filtered through the '`locale`' filter hook and
the value for the locale global set and the locale is returned.

The process to get the locale should only be done once but the locale
will always be filtered using the '`locale`' hook.

USAGE
-----

` <?php get_locale() ?> `

PARAMETERS
----------

None.

RETURN VALUES
-------------

 (string) 
:   The locale of the blog or from the '`locale`' hook.

EXAMPLES
--------

This sets the monetary locale and if empty, sets as en\_US

    setlocale(LC_MONETARY, get_locale());
    $my_local_settings = localeconv();
    if ($my_local_settings['int_curr_symbol'] == "") setlocale(LC_MONETARY, 'en_US');

This shows the value of setlocale:

    setlocale(LC_MONETARY, get_locale());
    print_r($my_local_settings);

NOTES
-----

-   Uses:
    [`apply_filters()`](/Function_Reference/apply_filters "Function Reference/apply filters")
    Calls '`locale`' hook on locale value.
-   Uses: `$locale` Gets the locale stored in the global.
-   Uses global: (`unknown`) `$locale`
-   *l10n* is an abbreviation for *localization*.
