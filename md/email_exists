NAME
----

email exists - This function will check whether or not a given email address (`$email`)

SYNOPSIS
--------

This function will check whether or not a given email address (`$email`)
has already been registered to a username, and returns that users ID (or
`false` if none exists). See also
[username\_exists](/Function_Reference/username_exists "Function Reference/username exists").

This function is normally used when a user is registering, to ensure
that the E-mail address the user is attempting to register with has not
already been registered.

    (*required*) The E-mail address to check
    Default: *None*

RETURN
------

-   If the E-mail exists, function returns the ID of the user to whom
    the E-mail is registered.
-   If the E-mail does not exist, function returns `false`.

EXAMPLES
--------

If the E-mail exists, echo the ID number to which the E-mail is
registered. Otherwise, tell the viewer that it does not exist.

    <?php
      $email = 'myemail@example.com';
      if ( email_exists($email) )
        echo "That E-mail is registered to user number " . email_exists($email);
