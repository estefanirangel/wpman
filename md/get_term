get term "MAY 2013" WordPress Codex "Function Reference"
========================================================

NAME
----

get term - Get all Term data from database by Term ID. To retrieve term data by

SYNOPSIS
--------

Get all Term data from database by Term ID. To retrieve term data by
name, slug or ID, use
[get\_term\_by()](/Function_Reference/get_term_by "Function Reference/get term by")
instead

The usage of the get\_term function is to apply filters to a term
object. It is possible to get a term object from the database before
applying the filters.

`$term` ID must be part of `$taxonomy`, to get from the database.
Failure, might be able to be captured by the hooks. Failure would be the
same value as [`$wpdb`](/Class_Reference/wpdb "Class Reference/wpdb")
returns for the get\_row method.

There are two hooks, one is specifically for each term, named
'`get_term`', and the second is for the taxonomy name,
'`term_$taxonomy`'. Both hooks gets the term object, and the taxonomy
name as parameters. Both hooks are expected to return a Term object.

'`get_term`' hook - Takes two parameters the term Object and the
taxonomy name. Must return term object. Used in **`get_term()`** as a
catch-all filter for every `$term`.

'`get_$taxonomy`' hook - Takes two parameters the term Object and the
taxonomy name. Must return term object. `$taxonomy` will be the taxonomy
name, so for example, if '`category`', it would be '`get_category`' as
the filter name. Useful for custom taxonomies or plugging into default
taxonomies.

EXAMPLES

Get Term offers some handy information, but unfortunately lacks a link
value.

`$term = get_term( $term_id, $taxonomy );`

Gives you term slug: e.g.: term-slug-example

`$slug = $term->slug;`

Gives you term name: e.g. Term Name Example

`$name = $term->name;`

Gives you term description: e.g. This is my new cool custom term.

`$desc = $term->description;`

NOTES
-----

-   See
    [`sanitize_term_field()`](/Function_Reference/sanitize_term_field "Function Reference/sanitize term field")
    The `$context` param lists the available values for
    [`get_term_by()`](/Function_Reference/get_term_by "Function Reference/get term by")
    `$filter` param.
-   Uses:
    [`sanitize_term()`](/Function_Reference/sanitize_term "Function Reference/sanitize term")
    Cleanses the term based on `$filter` context before returning.
-   Uses global: (`object`)
    [`$wpdb`](/Class_Reference/wpdb "Class Reference/wpdb")
