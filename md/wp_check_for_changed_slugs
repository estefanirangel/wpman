wp check for changed slugs "MAY 2013" WordPress Codex "Function Reference"
==========================================================================

NAME
----

wp check for changed slugs - Checked for changed slugs for published posts and save old slug.

SYNOPSIS
--------

Checked for changed slugs for published posts and save old slug.

The function is used along with form POST data. It checks for the
wp-old-slug POST field. Will only be concerned with published posts and
the slug actually changing.

If the slug was changed and not already part of the old slugs then it
will be added to the post meta field ('`_wp_old_slug`') for storing old
slugs for that post.

The most logically usage of this function is redirecting changed posts,
so that those that linked to an changed post will be redirected to the
new post.
