sanitize title "MAY 2013" WordPress Codex "Function Reference"
==============================================================

NAME
----

sanitize title - Sanitizes title or use fallback title.

SYNOPSIS
--------

Sanitizes title or use fallback title.

Specifically, [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "wikipedia:HTML")
and PHP tags are stripped, and (in a 'save' context) [accents are
removed](/Function_Reference/remove_accents "Function Reference/remove accents")
(accented characters are replaced with non-accented equivalents).
Further filtering can be added via the plugin API by hooking the
`sanitize_title` filter. If `$title` is empty and `$fallback_title` is
set, the latter will be used.

*Despite the name of this function, the returned value is intended to be
suitable for use in a URL, not as a human-readable title.*

USAGE
-----

` <?php sanitize_title( $title, $fallback_title, $context ) ?> `

PARAMETERS
----------

 `$title` 
:   ([*string*](/How_to_Pass_Tag_Parameters#String "How to Pass Tag Parameters"))
    (*required*) The string to be sanitized.
    Default: *None*

 `$fallback_title` 
:   ([*string*](/How_to_Pass_Tag_Parameters#String "How to Pass Tag Parameters"))
    (*optional*) A title to use if `$title` is empty.
    Default: ''

 `$context` 
:   ([*string*](/How_to_Pass_Tag_Parameters#String "How to Pass Tag Parameters"))
    (*optional*) The operation for which the string is sanitized.
    Default: 'save'

RETURN VALUES
-------------

 (string) 
:   The sanitized string.

EXAMPLES
--------

### WordPress Titles

To create the file name portion of a URL the same way that WordPress
does use this:

    <?php
      $new_url = sanitize_title('This Long Title is what My Post or Page might be');
      echo $new_url;
    ?>

It should return a formatted value, the output would be this:
` this-long-title-is-what-my-post-or-page-might-be`

NOTES
-----

The 'save' context is used most often when saving a value in the
database, but is used for other purposes as well. The 'query' context is
used by
[sanitize\_title\_for\_query()](/Function_Reference/sanitize_title_for_query "Function Reference/sanitize title for query")
when the value is going to be used in the `WHERE` clause of a query.
