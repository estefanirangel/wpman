wp salt - This function can be replaced via

SYNOPSIS
--------

This function can be replaced via
[plugins](/Glossary#plugins "Glossary"). If plugins do not redefine
these functions, then this will be used instead.

Get salt to add to hashes to help prevent attacks.

The secret key is located in two places: the database in case the secret
key isn't defined in the second place, which is in the wp-config.php
file. If you are going to set the secret key, then you must do so in the
[wp-config.php file](/Editing_wp-config.php "Editing wp-config.php").

The secret key in the database is randomly generated and will be
appended to the secret key that is in wp-config.php file in some
instances. It is important to have the secret key defined or changed in
`wp-config.php`.

If you have installed WordPress 2.5 or later, then you will have the
`SECRET_KEY` defined in the `wp-config.php` already. You will want to
change the value in it because hackers will know what it is. If you have
upgraded to WordPress 2.5 or later version from a version before
WordPress 2.5, then you should add the constant to your `wp-config.php`
file.

Salting passwords helps against tools which has stored hashed values of
common dictionary strings. The added values makes it harder to crack if
given salt string is not weak.
