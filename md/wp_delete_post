NOTES
-----

-   wp\_delete\_post() automatically reverts to
    [`wp_trash_post()`](/Function_Reference/wp_trash_post "Function Reference/wp trash post")
    if `$force_delete` is *false*, the `post_type` of `$postid` is
    *page* or *post*, `$postid` is not already in the trash **and** if
    [that trash
    feature](/Editing_wp-config.php#Empty_Trash "Editing wp-config.php")
    enabled (which it it is by default).
-   Uses:
    [`do_action()`](/Function_Reference/do_action "Function Reference/do action")
    on '`delete_post`' before deletion unless post type is
    '`attachment`'.
-   Uses:
    [`do_action()`](/Function_Reference/do_action "Function Reference/do action")
    on '`deleted_post`' after deletion unless `post type` is
    *attachment*.
-   Uses:
    [`wp_delete_attachment()`](/Function_Reference/wp_delete_attachment "Function Reference/wp delete attachment")
    if `post type` is *attachment*.
