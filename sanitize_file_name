Function Reference/sanitize file name « WordPress Codex
-----------

Sanitizes a filename replacing whitespace with dashes

Removes special characters that are illegal in filenames on certain
operating systems and special characters requiring special escaping to
manipulate at the command line. Replaces spaces and consecutive dashes
with a single dash. Trim period, dash and underscore from beginning and
end of filename.

The special characters are passed through the
[sanitize\_file\_name\_chars](/index.php?title=Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/sanitize_file_name_chars&action=edit&redlink=1 "Plugin API/Filter Reference/sanitize file name chars (page does not exist)")
filter before removing them from the file name, allowing plugins to
change which characters are considered invalid. After
`sanitize_file_name()` has done its work, it passes the sanitized file
name through the
[sanitize\_file\_name](/index.php?title=Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/sanitize_file_name&action=edit&redlink=1 "Plugin API/Filter Reference/sanitize file name (page does not exist)")
filter.
