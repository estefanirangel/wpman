Example
-------

To generate attachment metadata for attachment with parent post ID 37:

    <?php
      $attach_id = wp_insert_attachment( $attachment, $filename, 37 );
      $attach_data = wp_generate_attachment_metadata( $attach_id, $filename );
      wp_update_attachment_metadata( $attach_id,  $attach_data );
    ?>

Notes
-----

This function can be used to regenerate thumbnail and intermediate sizes
of the image after changes have been made on the
[Settings\_Media\_Screen](/Settings_Media_Screen "Settings Media Screen")
but it does not check or delete intermediate sizes it previously created
for the same image.

Thumbnail and intermediate sizes of the image, and ["sizes"] elements in
the array returned by this function, are only generated when the
intermediate size is smaller than the size of the image.

The function should be used in conjunction with
[wp\_update\_attachment\_metadata()](/Function_Reference/wp_update_attachment_metadata "Function Reference/wp update attachment metadata").

If this function is undefined in the environment where it is to be used,
such as within a Shortcode, use the include function:

    <?php include( ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/image.php' ); ?>

Source File
-----------

`wp_generate_attachment_metadata()` is located in
`wp-admin/includes/image.php`.
