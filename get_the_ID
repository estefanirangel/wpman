Function Reference/get the ID « WordPress Codex
-----------

Retrieve the numeric ID of the current post. This tag must be within
[The Loop](/The_Loop "The Loop").

Usage
-----

`  <?php get_the_ID(); ?> `

Parameters
----------

This tag has no parameters.

Returns
-------

 `ID` `(int)`{style="color:gray"} 
:   The ID of the current post.

Examples
--------

### Store the ID

The ID can be stored as a variable using
`  <?php $postid = get_the_ID(); ?> `

### Post Anchor Identifier

`get_the_ID()` Can be used to provide a unique anchor in a script. For
instance, a dynamically-generated drop down menu with actions for each
post in an archive could have

    <?php
    $id = get_the_ID();
    $dropdown = "<select name='dropdown-".$id."' >";
    $dropdown .= "<option id='option1-". $id ."'>Option 1</option>";
    $dropdown .= "</select>";
    ?>

This would allow us to use JavaScript to control the element as it has a
unique ID, and when submitting it as a form through the POST or GET
methods the dropdown box will be sent with a unique ID which allows the
script to note which post it is working on. Alternatively a hidden
variable could be sent which will allow the script to see which post the
submission is referring to

    <?php
    echo '<input type="hidden" name="activepost" id="activepost" value="'.get_the_ID().'" />';
    ?>

If the ID is not called within PHP, then we can use
[`the_ID`](/Template_Tags/the_ID "Template Tags/the ID") rather than
`echo get_the_ID();`

Change Log
