[post\_type](/Post_Type "Post Type") support provided via a secondary
parameter.

    <?php
    function count_user_posts_by_type( $userid, $post_type = 'post' ) {
        global $wpdb;

        $where = get_posts_by_author_sql( $post_type, true, $userid );

        $count = $wpdb->get_var( "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM $wpdb->posts $where" );

        return apply_filters( 'get_usernumposts', $count, $userid );
