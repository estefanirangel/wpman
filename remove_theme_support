### Removing a Feature In a Child Theme

In some cases, a Parent Theme may have activated a feature that you do
not want to have available in your Child Theme. For instance, if you are
using a parent theme that has activated Featured Images for all Pages
and Posts, but you'd like to remove the functionality of having Featured
Images for Pages in your Child Theme, you could do something like this:

    // in your Child Theme's functions.php    

    // Use the after_setup_theme hook with a priority of 11 to load after the
    // parent theme, which will fire on the default priority of 10
    add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'remove_featured_images_from_child_theme', 11 ); 

    function remove_featured_images_from_child_theme() {
        // This will remove support for post thumbnails on ALL Post Types
        remove_theme_support('post-thumbnails');
        // Add this line in to re-enable support for just Posts
        add_theme_support('post-thumbnails', array('post'));
    }
