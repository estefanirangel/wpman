Function Reference/wp unique filename « WordPress Codex
-----------

This function can be used before saving a file to make sure it has a
filename that is sanitized and unique for the given directory.

If the filename is not unique, then a number will be added to the
filename before the extension, and will continue adding numbers until
the filename is unique.

The callback is passed three parameters:

-   the first one is the directory
-   the second is the filename
-   the third is a callback function

Note: In the WordPress code comments the third parameter is described as
being the file extension. Looking at the function itself, this is not
true. The callback allows the caller to use their own method to create
unique file names. If defined, the callback should take three arguments
- directory, base filename, and extension and provide a unique filename.

Example
-------

    $newfilename = wp_unique_filename( $path_being_saved_to, $filename_to_check );

Source File
-----------

`wp_unique_filename()` is located in `wp-includes/functions.php`.
