Function Reference/register uninstall hook « WordPress Codex
-----------

Sets the uninstallation hook for a plugin. Available since WordPress
2.7.

Registers the uninstall hook that will be called when the user clicks on
the uninstall link that calls for the plugin to uninstall itself. The
link won't be active unless the plugin hooks into the action.

The plugin should not run arbitrary code outside of functions, when
registering the uninstall hook. In order to run using the hook, the
plugin will have to be included, which means that any code laying
outside of a function will be run during the uninstall process. The
plugin should not hinder the uninstall process.

If the plugin can not be written without running code within the plugin,
then the plugin should create a file named 'uninstall.php' in the base
plugin folder. This file will be called, if it exists, during the
uninstall process bypassing the uninstall hook.

When using 'uninstall.php' the plugin should always check for the
`WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN` constant, before executing. The
`WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN` constant is defined by WordPress at runtime during
a plugin uninstall, it will not be present if 'uninstall.php' is
requested directly.

Usage
-----

` <?php register_uninstall_hook($file, $callback) ?> `

### uninstall.php

    //if uninstall not called from WordPress exit
    if ( !defined( 'WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN' ) )
        exit ();

    delete_option('example');

Parameters
----------

 `$file` 
:   ([*string*](/How_to_Pass_Tag_Parameters#String "How to Pass Tag Parameters"))
    (*required*) The PHP file that the callback is located within.
    Default: *None*

 `$callback` 
:   ([*callback*](/How_to_Pass_Tag_Parameters#Callback "How to Pass Tag Parameters"))
    (*required*) The callback to run when the hook is called.
    Default: *None*

Notes
-----

Emphasis is put on using the 'uninstall.php' way of uninstalling the
plugin rather than register\_uninstall\_hook.
