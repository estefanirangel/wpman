Function Reference/the permalink « WordPress Codex
-----------

Displays the [URL](/Glossary#URI_and_URL "Glossary") for the
[permalink](/Glossary#Permalink "Glossary") to the post currently being
processed in [The Loop](/The_Loop "The Loop"). This tag must be within
[The Loop](/The_Loop "The Loop"), and is generally used to display the
permalink for each post, when the posts are being displayed. Since this
template tag is limited to displaying the permalink for the post that is
being processed, you cannot use it to display the permalink to an
arbitrary post on your weblog. Refer to
[get\_permalink()](/Template_Tags/get_permalink "Template Tags/get permalink")
if you want to get the permalink for a post, given its unique post id.

Usage
-----

`  <?php the_permalink(); ?> `

Parameters
----------

This tag has no parameters.

Examples
--------

### Display Post URL as Text

Displays the URL to the post, without creating a link:

    This address for this post is: <?php the_permalink(); ?>

### As Link With Text

You can use whatever text you like as the link text, in this case,
"permalink".

    <a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>">permalink</a>

### Used as Link With Title Tag

Creates a link for the permalink, with the post's title as the link
text. This is a common way to put the post's title.

    <a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>" title="<?php the_title_attribute(); ?>"><?php the_title(); ?></a>
